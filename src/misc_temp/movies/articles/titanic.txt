This is a revenue figure immediately outdated: 1000000000$.

This one uses a read-only data component: ${{Revenue}} millions.

This one is the read/write component: <wsf-data data-concept="movies" data-instance="Titanic" data-attribute="Revenue"></wsf-data>

I can also re-use components in articles for complex visualizations or interactions:
<wsf-cast data-title="Titanic"></wsf-cast>

I'm not really a big fan of Titanic, to be honest.
